# Meeting Notes October 2, 2025

- Jamal's idea:
	- Modular design
	- Microcontroller shared between some steps.
	- Single RasPi.
	- Configurable sounds, configured by RasPi
	- SDcard storage.
	- Design redundancy, failsafes
- Arabella agrees with Jamal?!
	- Not really opinionated
- Olivia's ideas:
	- Chromatic scale?
- Cameron's ideas:
	- Somehow agrees with Jamal
	- Sound decay
	- Touchscreen interactivity for volume, on/off
- David's idea:
	- Also agrees with Jamal?!  But not about in everything.
	- Maybe only a single sound system on RasPi
	- Decay parameter
	- Attack parameter
	- Analog sensor to avoid interference?
	- Beam breaker sensors, no AI involved.  Boring.
	- Olivia's task master.
- Evelyn's ideas:
	- See issues, MVP
	- Stretch goals would be good, attach to MVP issue
- Owen:
	- Everything's been stated.
- Nathan:
	- Recording sounds is not a good idea.
		- I disagree, Arabella and Brandon  agrees with me.
		- Use WSU UIDs to register.
- Mark's ideas:
	- Optimize number of microcontrollers
	- Transpositions is a thing, do it.
	- LED colors be black or white.  Black LEDs, I say.
		- David: BLACKLIGHTS
- Brandon:
	- Run it all on Fry with a whole lot of AI.  We all agree.
		- Mark: use an AI filter to keep recorded sounds appropriate.
		- Get Kijowski's permission.  Let Brandon know how it goes.
		- Mark agreed to make the model.
	- Mark: Use cameras and image recognition.
- Wens:
	- Speakers on each step: no latency
	- Decide on sensor choice.
	- Prototype early.
	- Wireless communications between microcontrollers
